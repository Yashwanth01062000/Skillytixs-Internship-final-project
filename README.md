# 🏥 MedXCare Predictive Healthcare Analytics 

This repository contains the final report for the **Healthcare Data Analytics & Risk Prediction Project** developed for **MedXCare Analytics**, a firm specializing in preventive healthcare strategies using Electronic Health Records (EHRs).



---

## 📌 Project Overview

MedXCare partnered with our analytics team to uncover insights from real-world EHR data. This dataset included demographics, lifestyle behaviors, chronic conditions, lab results, and historical medical information.

### 🎯 Objectives

- **Predict High-Risk Patients** (e.g., diabetes, heart disease) using ML models  
- **Enable Early Interventions** through actionable insights  
- **Provide Interactive Dashboards** for clinical decision-making  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Python** | Data preprocessing, EDA, ML modeling |
| **Pandas / NumPy** | Data manipulation |
| **Matplotlib / Seaborn** | EDA visualizations |
| **Scikit-learn** | Model training and evaluation |
| **SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL)** | Cohort segmentation, querying |
| **Power BI** | Interactive dashboard for risk profiling |
| **ReportLab** | Automated PDF generation |

## 🧪 Key Processes

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Imputation of missing values
- One-hot encoding of categorical variables
- Feature engineering (e.g., risk score, lifestyle index)

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution analysis of clinical metrics (BMI, glucose, etc.)
- Correlation heatmaps and behavior trends

### 3. Machine Learning Modeling
- Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests
- ROC-AUC, feature importance, and cross-validation

### 4. SQL-Based Risk Segmentation
- Identifying cohorts (e.g., age > 50, high glucose/HbA1c)

### 5. Dashboard Deployment
- Real-time filters (gender, age, risk)
- KPI summaries and visual storytelling in Power BI

---

## 📈 Key Findings

- 60% of patients are overweight or obese  
- Diabetes spikes after age 50  
- HbA1c > 6.5% and glucose > 140 mg/dL = high-risk  
- Lifestyle behaviors (smoking, alcohol) amplify clinical risk  

---

## ✅ Recommendations

- Targeted screenings for patients aged 50+  
- Lifestyle intervention programs for medium-risk patients  
- EHR integration with predictive alerts  
- Periodic model retraining for accuracy  

---

## 📊 Dashboard & Visuals

Included in the report are:
- 📉 EDA plots (heatmaps, histograms, scatter plots)
- 🤖 ML model visuals (feature importance, confusion matrix)
- 📊 Power BI dashboard screenshots with filters and KPIs
